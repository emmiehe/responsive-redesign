      <h4>A friend of mine used to live in a place that did not have easy access to laundry machines. He talked about this great service called "SimpleWash". But he also complained that their website was "messy", especially when he needed to change his pickup or delivery time, it would take him a few minutes to find the place to correct those info from the website. 
      </h4>
      <h4>
	As a student in a UI/UX CS class, I got curious about the website of SimpleWash laundry service. And I will talk about my discoveries and proposals after examining the their current homepage at simplewash.us.

	  <a href="https://www.simplewash.us"><h4 class="text-center">simplewash.us</h4></a>
	  <img src="./img/simplewash-screencapture.png" alt="A screencapture of the homepage of simplewash.us" style="height: 80rem; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px var(--bg-color-four);"/>

<!-- Finding Problems -->
<!-- Analyze the usability of the website using the criteria we learned about in class: usability, learnability, and memorability. Write about these problems, in the form of a list, table, infographic, or bullet points (depending on how you would like to present it in your portfolio!). It might be helpful to refer back to the Visual Design and Layout lectures. -->
<!-- Accessibility -->
	  <!-- In addition to analyzing the website on the four usability guidelines, use WebAIM WAVE to detect any possible accessibility concerns. Use a screen-reader to test how the website is interpreted by screen-readers. Write a few sentences about your findings.</p> -->
	<div class="d-flex flex-column">

	  <div class="container">
	    <h4>Issue One: untamed images</h4>
	    <p>When a user lands on the homepage of SimpleWash, the background image - a woman holding a "HELP" sign behind some half-folded clothes - effectively conveys the message that it is a laundry related service. While it is an impressive way to express how helpful this service could be, the high saturation of the image makes the texts and buttons floating on it very hard to read. In fact, a user could easily scroll over the most important function of this website - the "Schedule Now" button.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Issue Two: illegible texts</h4>
	    <p>Besides too many high saturation images, the small font size and low text-background contrast make the texts almost illegible. This point is further verified by <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/simplewash.us">WebAIM WAVE</a>: there are 27 contrast errors on the homepage. </p>
	    
	    <h4>Issue Three: redundant links</h4>
	    <p>There are at least 4 different links that lead to the same scheduling page. On top of that, many blank links don't lead anywhere - it seems they should appear as texts instead of links (for example, "Eco-friendly" and "Donations gladly taken" look like links, but they are just texts).</p>

	    <h4>Issue Four: overlapping content</h4>
	    <p>The page has a fixed menu bar but its background is transparent, making the content of the page overlapping the menu bar when a user scrolls up. This creates a messy look visually, which I assume is not ideal for a laundry service.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Issue Five: unclear structure</h4>
	    <p>The text and image grouping is not very meaningful. After scrolling over the entire page, the clearest message to me is "Share laundry day. Give & get $10!". All the other time I am bombarded with images and these images simply do not clearly depict the exact services of this business. This could potentially hurt the learnability of the website for first-time users like me.</p>

	    <h4>Issue Six: lacking memorability</h4>
	    <p>As my friend has pointed out, for casual users, it can be hard to remember where the "Change Delivery" button is (it is hiding under "Schedule") because the arrangement of functionalities is not intuitive.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Issue Seven: not as efficient</h4>
	    <p>I guess that the original design adds redundant links to increase efficiency, but what's interesting is that not every section of the webpage can be reachable from somewhere else. For example, if an experienced user wants to "share and get $10", they know such functionality exists, but when they land on the page they will not find it at the menu bar. Instead, they will have to scroll over most of the sections to find it.</p>
	    
	  </div>

	  <!-- <ul> -->
	  <!--   <li>Low contrast and poor text hierarchy, background image saturation is too high and makes the whole webpage look messy, poor color harmony - use WebAIM WAVE</li> -->
	  <!--   <li>Lack of a clear structure of each sections - for new user this can be confusing - poor grouping</li> -->
	  <!--   <li>Overwhelming pictures - adding a little texture to text blocks and simplify images by using icons</li> -->
	  <!--   <li>Redundent links - main functionality is not highlighted by layout but by repeated appearance</li> -->
	  <!--   <li>Usability (for new users and casual users)</li> -->
	  <!--   <li>Inefficiency</li> -->
	  <!-- </ul> -->

	  <li>Each section has its own div and the homepage (first section) and the contact page should have almost white background to have a clean look.</li>
	  <li>Each section uses flexbox to handle responsiveness: for example, the "Services" section is one flex-column containing three flex-row, the second flex-row is reversed to make the grouping appear interesting.</li>
	  <li>Majority of original webpage's images are replaced with simple icons to make it less distracting for a user to read.</li>
	  <li>The "Help" background will show up on larger devices as a fixed background cover, but will not appear on medium to small devices.</li>
	  <li>All forms use bootstrap form style with a btn-block submit button to allow easy clicking for users. Placeholders are not shown in the prototype but should follow the original page's place holder style to avoid confusion from existing customers.</li>

<!-- For each prototype, annotate the different elements so that an engineer would be able to take your designs and reproduce them without needing additional explanation. Annotate how your website would be responsive to handle the different screen sizes. Is it clear how the styling and/or structuring of each element  will change when you move from desktop to mobile to tablet? Here are some example questions to consider annotating: -->
<!-- For larger containers, will you be using flexbox, grid, or something else? Why? -->
<!-- Does the page change because of a user-action (such as a click or a hover)? How? -->
<!-- 	</p> -->
<!--       </div> -->
      
<!--       <div class="text-center"> -->
<!-- 	<h2>Visual Design Style Guide</h2> -->
<!-- 	<p>For any elements that change on events (e.g., on hover, on click), keeping their interactions consistent throughout a product keeps the user experience coherent. Clear documentation also makes handoffs to developers easier. Here is an example. Create a visual design style guide that displays the main colors, typography, and reusable components’ different states (buttons on hover, click, etc.). We expect to see all major components included in your style guide, but how many components this totals to will vary based on your design choices. Focus on interactive elements like input fields over colors and fonts.  -->

      <p>Some thoughts: it is often easy to claim that a website is badly designed without pinpointing the exact issues and providing solutions to those issues. While I certainly have had fun redesigning the homepage of SimpleWash, I have also realized how much work there is to design, prototype, and implement even a simple webpage.  </p>
